## Summary
I am currently a student in the Sigma Prime 10.0 program, mentored by Shradha Khapra, where I am building a rigorous foundation in full-stack development. I have successfully completed the frontend specialization, mastering the ability to create responsive, mobile-first web interfaces using custom CSS and the Bootstrap framework. My current focus is transitioning into backend development, where I am learning to build robust server-side architectures, manage databases, and integrate complex logic to create fully functional, end-to-end web applications.
